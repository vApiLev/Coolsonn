# cats_vs_dogs
This time I am trying to face the Keggle's challange on cassifying cats and dogs photos with the use of Convolutional Neural Networks.<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats <br>
The project was my final work for "Intro to Python and ML" course at Kozminsku University.<br><br>

I used the Keras library to create my model that distinguishes Cats and Dogs on photos with more then <b>90% accuracy</b> on test data<br>
It was fed with more tahn 20k of various pictures presenting Cat and Dogs (and also some faces of trolls who decided to upload them to an open-source datase 😅)<br><br>

Finaly I showed the photo of my dog to the model and it was pretty sure that it's seeing a dog 😁 <br>
Here is the photo:<br>

And here is what the algorithm said: <br>

<br><br>
Feel free to contact me in case of any comments or recommendations concerning my work 😁 I'll be pleased to discuss about this (or any other project) and maybe learn something new <br> <br>
I am looking forward to accomplish more ML projects! -- Stay Tuned! 🙌
